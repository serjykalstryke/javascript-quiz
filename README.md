# javascript-quiz

a basic quiz app that uses Javascript to make an interactive web application. 

The application iterates through a series of question objects nested in an array. Correct answers give 100 points which are displayed on a point counter. 

There is a timer, when the time runs out a gameover page is displayed. If you complete the quiz you have the option to save your high score.
