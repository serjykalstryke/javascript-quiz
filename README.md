# javascript-quiz

a basic quiz app that uses Javascript to make an interactive web application which tests user knowledge on some basic javascript history and concepts. 

The application iterates through a series of question objects nested in an array. Correct answers give 100 points which are displayed on a point counter. 

There is a timer, when the time runs out a gameover page is displayed. Incorrect answers result in a 20 second time deduction. If you complete the quiz in time you have the option to save your high score and then play again.
